# Phase 5 – Task 04: Grafana Dashboards (Platform Level)

## Task Type
Observability / Visualization

## Context
Raw metrics are insufficient. Dashboards provide insight.

## Objective
Create Grafana dashboards for the EV platform.

## Deliverables
- Service health dashboard:
  - Request rate
  - Error rate
  - Latency
- Infrastructure dashboard:
  - Pod CPU/memory
  - Restarts
- Eventing dashboard:
  - Messages published/consumed
  - Outbox backlog

## Constraints
- Dashboards must be reusable across environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Dashboards load and display real data.

## Stop Condition
Stop after dashboards are reviewed and saved.
