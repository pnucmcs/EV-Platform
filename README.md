# Smart EV Charging & Parking Platform

This repository contains a .NET 8 microservices platform for EV charging and parking, designed for Kubernetes with Docker, Helm, RabbitMQ, Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and OpenTelemetry-based observability. It follows a monorepo layout for easier shared tooling, consistent CI/CD, and local compose-based development.

## Current Phase

- **Phase 0 — High-Level Architecture & Repo Strategy**: architecture summary, naming conventions, and proposed repository layout are documented in `docs/architecture.md`.

## Quick Links

- Architecture & naming: `docs/architecture.md`

## Next

- Proceed to Phase 1 to set up the local dev environment (dotnet, docker, kubectl, helm) once the Phase 0 artifacts are reviewed.
